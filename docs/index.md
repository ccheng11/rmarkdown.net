# R Markdown

R Markdown is a powerful tool that allows you to create reports, presentations, and articles using R code. This short guide will show you how to get started with R Markdown in under two minutes! We will use the RStudio IDE, but you can use any text editor you prefer.


## Installation

R Markdown comes along with RStudio. If you do decide to use a different IDE, you need to install the rmarkdown package from CRAN. You can do this by running the following code in R:

```md
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

## Getting start

Next, open RStudio and create a new file. Select "File" > "New File" > "R Markdown". This will open a template R Markdown file for you -  files in R Markdown have the extension ".Rmd",


```md

```





The first part of this file in the YAML header specifies the document's title, author, and date.
